# ChestXray

This repository implements a 121-layer [Densnet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993.pdf) which achieved near state of the art performance on the [ChestXray14](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02315.pdf) dataset. You can read my paper [here](https://github.com/colganwi/ChestXray/blob/master/paper/paper.pdf).

The framework is borrowed from [TensorFlow-Slim Models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim) 

## Usage

First follow the instructions for [TensorFlow-Slim Models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim)
